### 15. The Main Event: The `main` Function

The `main` function orchestrates the entire animation system:

**The Core Ingredients: What Makes This System Tick?**

Our example code brings together several key components to create believable character motion:

1.  **Motion Matching:** Imagine having a vast library of animations. Motion matching is the technique of intelligently searching this library to find the animation clip that best fits the character's _current_ desired state and, crucially, its _predicted future_ movement. This allows for highly responsive and context-aware animation.

2.  **Physics Simulation:** Instead of purely relying on pre-recorded animations for root movement, a physics simulation handles the character's high-level locomotion. This allows for dynamic responses to the environment, like collisions with obstacles, and a natural feel to movement based on desired velocities and accelerations.

- **Initialization:** Sets up everything from the Raylib window and camera to loading assets (models, shaders, animation database).
- **Game Loop:** This is where the magic happens every frame:
  - Reads input.
  - Updates desired states.
  - Predicts the trajectory.
  - Performs motion matching.
  - Updates the inertialization.
  - Runs the physics simulation.
  - Applies synchronization, adjustment, and clamping.
  - Performs inverse kinematics.
  - Updates the character mesh deformation.
  - Updates the camera.
  - **Rendering:** Draws the entire scene, including the character, environment, and debugging visualizations.
  - **GUI:** Provides a user interface to tweak various parameters in real-time.
- **Shutdown:** Cleans up resources before exiting.
